Algorithm:
Make values of a, b, c, and n global so you can use it in the check_fermat function
    #global a
    #global b
    #global c
    #global n
Develop check_fermat
    #def check_fermat():
    Make an if statement to see if Fermat's Last Theorem is true
        #if (a**n) + (b**n) == c**n
    Print the statement "Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!" if the equation is equal.
        #(print("Holy smokes, Fermat was wrong!"))
    Make else statement
        #else
    Print the statement"No, that does not work." if the value of an + bn does not equal cn
        #print("No, that does not work.")
Develop main function
    #def main():
    Add introduction
        # print("This program tests Fermat's Final Formula (a^n + b^n can not equal c^n if n is greater than 2)")
    Ask for input of a and set it to the global variable a
        # a = eval(input("What is the value of a?"))
    Ask for input of b and set it to the global variable b
        #b = eval(input("What is the value of b?"))
    Ask for input of c and set it to the global variable c
        #c = eval(input("What is the value of c?"))
    Ask for input of n and set it to the global variable n
        #n = eval(input("What is the value of n? The value of n must be greater than 2."))
    Call back to the check_fermat function
        #check_fermat()
    end main function
        #main()
