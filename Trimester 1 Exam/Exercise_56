# Program Description
# This program determines if a triangle can be made given three side lengths
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# make variables a, b, and c global
# gather inputs for side lengths
# create is_triangle function
#         if a + b <= c:
#         answer = False
#         return answer
#     elif b + c <= a:
#         answer = False
#         return answer
#     elif c + a <= b:
#         answer = False
#         return answer
#     else:
#         answer = True
#         return answer
# set answer to the function
# add an if statement to determine if answer is true or false
# add two concluding messages with the side lengths based on if the thing is true or false
#
# insert concluding statement
