# Program Description
# Uses a definition/function (squareEach)
# to square a list of numbers given by the user
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# - Input number list in for of a string
# - Make "SquareEach" function
#   - split string into a list of numbers
#   - Have an "if True" statement to test if
#     a "ValueError" will occur, if so, print
#     a warning prompt, if not, continue def
#   - for loop to run each number through
#     and square it. Use this value to print
#     a conclusion
#     ("input" squared is "output".)
# - End function/code
#
#
