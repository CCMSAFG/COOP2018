# Program Description
# This program sums the values in a number provided by the user and the sum of its cubes.
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# Print intro
# Get how high the numbers go up to from user
# - Define sum of that input using for loop and accumulator
# - Define sum of the input's cubes using for loop and accumulator
# format response
