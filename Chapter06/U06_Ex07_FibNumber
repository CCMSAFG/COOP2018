# Program Description
# This is a program for the Fibonacci number for a value you input.
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# - Print Introduction
# - Get the value of "n" from user input
# - Have the program test to see if "n"
#   is a positive integer
#   (if not, print an error message)
# - run a "fib_number" function
#   * set up 3 variables
#     x = 0
#     y = 1
#     z = 0
#   * test to see if "n" is 3 or greater
#     (If not, return their value in a variable)
#     (If so, z = y + x
#             y = x
#             x = z
#      then run this through a loop "n" times)
#   * put the final value into a variable and
#     return that variable
# - Use the returned variable to format a conclusion
# - Make sure all the data types are compatible for
#   print statements
