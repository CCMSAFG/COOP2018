# Program Description
# Uses a definition/function (toNumber)
# to convert a series of numbers given by the
# user into the data-type integer.
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# - Input number list in for of a string
# - Make "toNumber" function
#   - split string into a list of numbers (str)
#   - Have an "if True" statement to test if
#     a "ValueError" will occur, if so, print
#     a warning prompt, if not, continue def
#   - for loop to run each number through
#     and convert to int (x_int = int(x))
#     Use this value to print
#     a conclusion
# - End function/code
#
