# Program Description
# Uses a definition/function (sumList)
# to add a series of numbers given by the
# user in the form of a list.
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# - Input number list in for of a string
# - Make "sumList" function
#   - split string into a list of numbers
#   - Have an "if True" statement to test if
#     a "ValueError" will occur, if so, print
#     a warning prompt, if not, continue def
#   - for loop to run each number through
#     and add it to the previous value
#     (initial value = 0)
#     Use this value to print
#     a conclusion
# - End function/code
