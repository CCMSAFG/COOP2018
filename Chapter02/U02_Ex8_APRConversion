# Program Description
# Uses Percentage Rate, Number of compounds, and number of years to determine the APR of an input.
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# Ask for the percentage rate in percent
# Ask how many times the number will be compounded
# Ask for initial value
# make the percent a decimal
# Run through the apr equation apr = amount*(1+(percentage Rate/Number of compounds))**Number of Compounds
# Print output


def main():
    pr = eval(input("What is the percentage rate in percent?"))
    a = eval(input("How often is the percentage rate compounded per year?"))
    amount = eval(input("What is the value of money being compounded?"))
    ppr = (pr/100)
    apr = amount*(1+(ppr/a))**a
    print(int(apr))


main()
