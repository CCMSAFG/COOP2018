# Program Description
# Adds the cubes of consecutive positive integers up to a desired number
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# Introduce the program
# Ask for the number of cubes to be added
# start with total = 0
# for loop from 1 -> n (including the value of n)
# Store the value of total after each time through the loop by using itself in the definition of itself.
# print the list of sum of cubes all to the desired number


def main():
    print("This program sums the values of a number of cubes supplied by the user.")
    n = eval(input("how many positive integers' cubes would you like to add?"))
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        total = total + i**3

        print(total)


main()
