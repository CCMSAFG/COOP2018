# Program Description
# this program finds the height of the ladder given the
# height of the wall and the angle of the ladder using
# the value of sine.
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# import math
# ask for height
# ask for angle of the ladder
# transfer form radians to degrees
# divide height by the degree times sine ( h / (math.sin(degrees))
# print conclusion with the value of the length of the ladder.


def main():
    import math
    h = int(input("What is the height of the wall?"))
    angle = int(input("What is the angle of the ladder?"))
    degrees = angle*(math.pi / 180)
    length = h / (math.sin(degrees))
    print('The ladder needs to be {:>.4f} units large'.format(length))
