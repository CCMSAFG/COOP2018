# Program Description
# This program calculates the molecular weight of a carbohydrate molecule
# given user inputs for the number of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms in the molecule.
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# intro
# define m-weight of H, C, and O
#    (hydrogen = 1.00794
#     carbon = 12.0107
#     oxygen = 15.9994)
# number of atoms times weight
# print final weight and conclusion
#
