# Program Description
# This code finds the number of words in a sentence
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# - Get sentence input
# - Split the input separating the "words" by spaces
# - Make that split string into a list and count the number of
#   elements in that list
# - Test the raw input for letters using a for loop
# - If there are no letters print a statement saying that
# - If letters are in the string, set up an "if, elif, else"
#   statement to print the corresponding results
#   - If there is one word, say  something like,
#     "your input _____ is a single word"
#   - If there are multiple(x) words print something like,
#     "Your input contains x words"
#   - If it contains no words print something like,
#     "Your input contains no words"
