# Program Description
# This code finds the number of words in a sentence
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# Get sentence input
# count number of spaces
# add one to number of spaces (this is the number of words)
# setup output with an "if" statement
#   if the number of words is 1,
#   then use singular form of words in that sentence
#
#   if the number of words is > 1,
#   then use the plural form of words in that sentence
