# Program Description
# Finds the character, word, and line count
#   of a file provided by the user
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# Have user input file name
# open the file to be read
# read the file
#
# CHARACTER COUNT:
# - Set up a list of all characters
# - Lower all letters in the
#   opened file to shorten character
#   list
# - Set base value of characters to 0
#   to accumulate
# - Set up for loop  to test every aspect
#   of the file to see if it is a
#   character in the character list
#
# LINE COUNT:
# - Set initial line count as 0
# - Use a for loop inside a "with as"
#   statement to count total lines
#
# PREP FOR WORD COUNT:
# - Close the file
# - Open the same file to read line
#   by line
#
# WORD COUNT:
# - Set initial word value to 0
# - Using the value found for line
#   count, set up for loop in range
#   of that value.
# - For every line, use the .readline()
#   function
# - Split the read line by spaces
#   and turn that split function
#   into a list
# - Use len function to count the
#   elements of the list
# - Add previous loop value too current
#   value until loops complete leaving
#   the proper word count
#
# CONCLUSION
# - Format character, word, and line count
#
