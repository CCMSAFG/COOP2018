# Program Description
# This prints out the number date and the
# date when the month is text (January, February, etc.)
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# Gain Day, Month, and Year input (numeric value)
#
# convert the int's into string as it is inputted into the
# first date order (month/day/year)
#
# Using chunks of string of January through December separated
# by comas, assign a variable to equal the int input of
# "month" -1 as in a group of string, the first segment
# is classified as 0 rather than 1
#
# Organize the second date configuration (TextMonth/day/year)
#
# Print both types of date configurations


def main():
    # get the day month and year as numbers
    day = int(input("Enter the day number: "))
    month = int(input("Enter the month number: "))
    year = int(input("Enter the year: "))

    date1 = str(month)+"/"+str(day)+"/"+str(year)

    months = ["January", "February", "March", "April",
              "May", "June", "July", "August",
              "September", "October", "November", "December"]
    monthStr = months[month-1]
    date2 = monthStr+" " + str(day) + ", " + str(year)

    print("The date is", date1, "or", date2+".")


main()
