# Program Description
# This code finds the average word length of a sentence
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# Get sentence input
# split string sentence
# add str of all capital and lowercase letters
# count number of spaces and add one to find number or words
# for loop for all the words in the split list
#      for loop for all the letters in the word
#           check how many times that character(both cap ad lowercase)
#           is in the letter list and add to a growing total
#           (should be a value of 1 for each letter)
# have a growing total for the letter value, word value, and sentence value
# divide the sentence value by number of words and round that value to a whole number
# conclusion
#
