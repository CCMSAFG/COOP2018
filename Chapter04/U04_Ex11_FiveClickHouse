# Program Description
# This program allows the user to build a house in five clicks.
# First two clicks: Makes a rectangular frame with each click being a corner
# Third click: Places a door 1/5 of the house's frame
# Fourth click: Draws a window around the point you clicked
# Fifth click: Makes the point you clicked the peak of the roof
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# import graphics
# make win
# set coords
# make intro
# getMouse
# undraw intro
# make ground
# make sky
# make sun
# add instruction (click twice) to make frame
# mark clicks
# use points to make rectangle
# add instruction
# make door using click
# add instruction
# make window around click coordinates
# add instruction
# make triangle to make roof
# (first point = click5, second point = click1, third point =(click2 x-value), click1 y-value))
# add conclusion
# win.getMouse
# win.close
