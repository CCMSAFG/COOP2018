# Program Description
# This program allows the user to draw 10 squares based off
# of where they click in the window using a graphics folder
# and a for loop.
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# Import graphics library
# Create a GraphWin
# Create intro near the middle that un-draws after a single click
# set initial top left corner of square as variable (p1)
# set bottom right corner in terms of p1 (p2)
# define square as a rectangle
# set fill and outline red and draw the square
# for loop to draw squares based on where the mouse clicks on the window
# clone the square for each click (10 times)
# conclusion statement that closes the window after the window is clicked one final time.
