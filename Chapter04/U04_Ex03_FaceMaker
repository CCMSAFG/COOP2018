# Program Description
# This program produces a graphic of a face
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# import graphics
# make window
# draw face using a make_circle definition
# draw eyes using make_circle definition
# make nose out of an angled line with negative slope and one with a slope of 0
# draw mouth using an oval and a rectangle covering the top half og the oval to
# create the illusion of an arc
# allow the user to exit the program using an input statement
