# Program Description
# This code finds the Greatest Common Divisor
# between two numbers given by the user.
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# - Intro
#
# - Get the first and second value
#
# - Find which number is lower
#
# - Initialize the Greatest Common Divisor variable
#
# - For loop with the range from 1 to (the lower number + 1)
#       if both x and y % i = 0 it is a common divisor,
#       the last common factor found will be the greatest
#       common divisor
#
# - Print and format the GCD
