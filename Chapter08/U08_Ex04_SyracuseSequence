# Program Description
# This code sends a given input through the Syracuse Sequence.
# It is hypothesized that every integer greater than one
# will conclude the sequence at one.#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# - Intro
#
# - Get input
#
# - Store starting value for later use
#
# - Set up while loop, so it
#   continues until the sequence value
#   equals one
#
# - Have the input go through the
#   Syracuse Sequence given
#
# - Print that value before going
#   back through the loop
#
# - After while loop finishes,
#   print "1" for styling
#
# - Conclusion using stored
#   starting value
