# Program Description
# This program will figure out if a year entered
# by the user is a leap year or not
# (A year is a leap year if it divisible by 4,
# unless it is the beginning of a new century
# that isn't divisible by 400.
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# - Intro
# - Get year number from input
# - make a "calculation" function
#    - If the remainder of input/400 is 0
#      and remainder of input/100 is also 0,
#      set and return the value of "true"
#    - If the remainder of input/4 is 0
#      and remainder of input/100 is not 0,
#      set and return the value of "true"
#    - if these aren't true return "false"
# - if function(input) is true, print that
#   that year was/will be a leap year
# - if function(input) is false, print that
#   that year wasn't/won't be a leap year
#


def main():
    print("This program tests a year number to see if it is a leap year.")
    year_number = input("Please input a year to determine if it is/was a leap year:")
    if leap_year_calc(year_number):
        print('\nThe year, {0}, is a leap year.'.format(year_number))
    else:
        print('\nThe year, {0}, is not a leap year.'.format(year_number))


def leap_year_calc(year):
    int_year = int(year)
    if int_year % 400 == 0 and int_year % 100 == 0:
        return True
    elif int_year % 4 == 0 and int_year % 100 != 0:
        return True
    else:
