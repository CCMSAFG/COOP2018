# Program Description
# This program uses Podunksville's speeding
# ticket fine policy to determine the cost of
# a speeding ticket.
#
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# - Intro
# - Get speed limit from user
# - Get the speed of the vehicle from user
# - make a "fine calculation" function
#   - checks if vehicle speed was over speed limit
#      - if so, continue
#      - if not, return 0
#   - (Vehicle speed - speed limit)x5 = additional cost
#   - if Vehicle speed is 90 or more,
#     the base fine changes from $50 to $200
#   - Add base fine to additional cost and return that value
# - Print conclusion
#
